    <h1>Indoor Plant Fertilizing Calendar – Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>How often should I fertilize my indoor plants?</h2>
    <p>Most houseplants benefit from feeding every 4–6 weeks during active growth in spring and summer. Over-fertilizing can burn roots, so always follow product instructions.</p>

    <h2>Do indoor plants need fertilizer in winter?</h2>
    <p>During winter, most plants enter a rest period. Reduce or stop fertilizing until early spring unless you have grow lights or tropical varieties.</p>

    <h2>What kind of fertilizer is best for houseplants?</h2>
    <p>Use a balanced liquid fertilizer like 10-10-10 or 20-20-20 diluted to half-strength. For flowering plants, a bloom booster may be appropriate.</p>

    <h2>Can I use organic fertilizer for my indoor plants?</h2>
    <p>Yes. Organic options like fish emulsion, worm castings, and seaweed extract are great alternatives, though they may have stronger smells.</p>

    <h2>Should I water before or after fertilizing?</h2>
    <p>Water first if your soil is dry. Fertilizing dry roots may damage them. Always apply fertilizer to moist soil for even absorption.</p>
